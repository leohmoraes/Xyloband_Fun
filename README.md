# Xyloband_Fun
Used for PIC Microcontroller project to activate and illuminate the Xyloband (LED wrist band as used by Coldplay).

This repo is used to hold all the information from a project I am making to re-activate the Xyloband after a Coldplay concert. The Xyloband is an LED wristband which is activated by signals Tx during the concert at around 868MHz.

The project will be based around the Microchip PIC16LF1824T39A.

The aim is to mount the part along with the etched antenna then to play with the Pulse Rep Frequency and pulse widths/protocol until something meaningful happens on the Xyloband....keep you informed.
